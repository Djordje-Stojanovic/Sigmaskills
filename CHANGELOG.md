# Changelog

All notable changes to [Sigmaskills](https://github.com/Djordje-Stojanovic/Sigmaskills) are documented here.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-11

First public release. Portable [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) for Codex, Pi, Claude Code, Cursor, and compatible hosts.

### Idea

Ship high-rigor, installable agent skills (not apps): full-repo audits, performance investigation, parallel-agent briefing, and clear technical writing voice — each with a tight operating contract and `npx skills add` / Codex `$skill-installer` install paths.

### Skills

- **SigmaReview** (`sigmareview`) — One-shot full-repository engineering audit; single findings Markdown report opened as a report-only PR; no runtime code changes.
- **SigmaPerformance** (`sigmaperformance`) — Calibrated, audit-only performance investigation; measured and mechanically proven bottlenecks; single report PR; no runtime-source edits by default.
- **SigmaBrief** (`sigmabrief`) — Prompt factory: turns issues/work into paste-ready agent briefs; chat-only; does not implement or open product fix PRs.
- **SigmaWrite** (`sigmawrite`) — STE-inspired clear technical English for explanations; soft steers (not hard numbered rules); pasteable system-prompt block; chat style only.

### Repository

- MIT license and root README with multi-host install/run/output contracts (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Pi, OpenCode, LAPI-style paths, and Agent Skills–compatible TUIs).
- GitHub Issue Forms + PR template (from github-issue-kit), tailored to Agent Skills / prompts / templates work.
- Packaged GitHub Release **v0.1.0** with source zip of all skills.
